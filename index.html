      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        My interest in computer programming and design comes from an early passion for computers. I was a DOS gamer back in the early 90s. I fondly recall deleting my family's C: drive, forcing my mother to sit in front of the computer for hours with the stack of twenty floppy disks needed to install Windows 3.1.

        As I got older I found school less fulfilling. I was often in the position of questioning the decisions that my teachers were making, which incited a lifelong interest in teaching and human development. I felt that since humans had evolved along with the world, our consciousnesses must also have evolved. I wanted to take part in the process of human evolution.

        I went to Bennington College in Vermont, a lawless institution where I made my own education. I studied education and writing for performance. While there I worked with the local school's at-risk student population and was <span class="imp">employed</span> in a psychiatric hospital. When I graduated I moved to Portland, where I did social work with homeless adolescents and young adults.
