        I was an avid DOS gamer as a child in the early 90s. I fondly remember deleting my family's C: drive, forcing my mother to sit in front of the computer for hours with the stack of twenty floppy disks needed to install Windows 3.1. Breaking software and then fixing it was a hobby, but it was only in the last few years that it became a professional ambition. Before that, I worked in education and human development.

        I was an avid DOS gamer as a child in the early 90s. I fondly remember deleting my family's C: drive from the DOS prompt, forcing my mother to sit in front of the computer for hours with the stack of twenty floppy disks needed to install Windows 3.1. Breaking software and then fixing it was a hobby, but it was only in the last few years that it became a professional ambition. Before that, I worked in social services and human development.

        In school I was always watching the teachers and the decisions they made. I was curious how and why they taught the way they did. I dreamt of a better version of school. After high school I went to Bennington College in Vermont. It was a lawless institution that allowed me to create my own BA in Education and Writing for Performance (mostly plays, screenplays, and standup). While there I worked with the local school's at-risk student population and was <span class="imp">employed</span> in a psychiatric hospital. When I graduated I moved to Portland, where I worked with homeless adolescents and young adults.

        At this point I was getting older and wanted a stable career. I went into a Master's program at Lewis and Clark College to learn how to teach Language Arts at the middle and high school level. I stayed an extra year to become a Special Education teacher, having found that I had a knack for working with children who struggled to access school. While employed as a teacher I wrote articles about neurodiversity, equity, and inclusion.

      <p>
        After I left teaching, I wanted to do something new. My previous jobs had given me great soft skills, but I was interested in learning a trade that would engage my interests in writing, education, and human evolution. I had always maintained an art practice and was learning how to use machine learning to generate art. While playing around with Python scripts, I had an <span class="imp">Aha!</span> moment: this is a powerful tool and I can learn to use it.

        After eight years of teaching, I wanted to try something new. My previous jobs had given me great soft skills, but I was interested in learning a trade that would engage my interests in writing, education, and human evolution. I had always maintained an art practice of some kind and was following developments in machine learning. While playing around with Python scripts to generate digital art, I had an <span class="imp">Aha!</span> moment: this is a powerful tool, and I can learn to use it.
