      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I was a DOS gamer back in the early 90s. I fondly recall deleting my family's C: drive, forcing my mother to sit in front of the computer for hours with the stack of twenty floppy disks needed to install Windows 3.1. Breaking software and then fixing it was a hobby, but it was only in the last few years that it became a professional ambition.
      </p>
      <p>
        In school I was always watching the teachers and the decisions they made. I was curious how and why they taught the way they did. I dreamed of a better version of school. After high school I went to Bennington College in Vermont. It was a lawless institution that allowed me to create my own major in education and writing for performance. While there I worked with the local school's at-risk student population and was <span class="imp">employed</span> in a psychiatric hospital. When I graduated I moved to Portland, where I worked with homeless adolescents and young adults.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point I was getting older and wanted a full career. I went into a Master's program at Lewis and Clark College to learn how to teach Language Arts at the middle and high school level. I stayed an extra year to become a Special Education teacher, having found that I had a knack for working with children who struggled to access school due to their neurodiversity.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I left teaching, I wanted to do something new. My previous jobs taught me exceptional soft skills. I could communicate with almost anyone, hear their story, and help them move towards their goals. But I wanted to learn a trade, something that would engage my interests in writing, education, and the user experience. I had always maintained an art practice of some kind, trying a little of one medium and then another. I was following developments in machine learning, like Google's Deep Dream program. While playing around with Python scripts to generate ridiculous images, I had an <span class="imp">Aha!</span> moment: I could program computers to do what I wanted. I decided that would be the focus of the next phase of my life.

      <h2>Personal Interests and Hobbies</h2>
      My primary interest outside of work is art. I listen to more music than most, with an ear to discover new sounds that I have not encountered before. Beyond that, I enjoy making art in a variety of different mediums (including the art of cooking). Here are some of my projects:
